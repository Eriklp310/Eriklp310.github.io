    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I'm Erik Langdon Potts. I graduated from Windham-Ashland-Jewett in the Catskills.
    <br>I enjoy learning and teaching martial arts on the side. I also enjoy messing around
    <br>with computer programs that I don't understand. Philosophical conversations and
    <br>debates are also always interesting and enjoyable.
